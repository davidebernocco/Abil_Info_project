# Galaxies and Statistics
Project for an entry level course on python scientific programming (UniTs)

What you just need in order to put your hands on the code and make it run is simply download from Github and execute the bash file Bash_Script.sh on your terminal: \
`chmod +x Bash_Script.sh`\
`bash Bash_Script.sh`\
It will download and arrange all the data sets needed for the analysis alonside the jupyter notebook and the library Statistical_functions in a folder you have to specify.\
Then just execute from terminal:\
`cd /the/choosen/path/for/the/folder/Bernocco_AbilInfo`\
`jupyter notebook`

Further information about the physical meaning of the analysis that is carried here can be found, summarized, in the pdf file in this directory (credits Prof. Monaco).
