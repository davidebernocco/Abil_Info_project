# Galaxies and Statistics
Project for an entry level course on python scientific programming (UniTs)

What you just need in order to put your hands on the code and make it run properly is simply download the ipynb file and the library Statistcal_functions and execute the bash file Bash_Script.sh on your terminal. It will download and arrange all the data sets needed for the analysis in a folder you have to specify: make sure it is the same which contains the jupyter notebook and the python library! 

Further information about the physical meaning of the analysis that is carried here can be found, summarized, in the pdf file in this directory (credits Prof. Monaco).
